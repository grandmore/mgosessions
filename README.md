mgosessions
===============
An golang mgo (Mongodb) session store for martini. 

Since Martini uses Gorilla this store extends gorilla to create a sessions store using Mongo.

The code is pretty much unmodified from the original Gorilla code on another project but it was not packaged up so I packaged it up for martini.
